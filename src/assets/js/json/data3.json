	"quote": " In the late 19th century, the Asante state had a fiscally functioning and effective system of accountancy, taxation and even a ‘national’ treasury. The latter was a kind of state bank called the ‘Great Chest of the Treasury’, which was located in the palace of the Asantehene in Kumasi, where gold dust (metallic money) was deposited. In the 20th century, moreover, successful Asante entrepreneurs and traders operating between Asante and the Gold Coast Colony used gold dust currency to trade in commodities including gold, rubber, cocoa and timber. They also provided services as moneylenders, gold dealers, investors, retailers, transportation suppliers and urban developers. Asante businessmen were also involved in the import-export trade. ",
