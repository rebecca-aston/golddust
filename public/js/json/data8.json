	"quote": "In the past the designs undoubtedly signified something but the art of interpreting them is lost. One octogenarian goldsmith explained, \"We use our brains when making the weights. They mean something to us. Any fish in the river or in the sea, any animal on earth or anything else on earth can be modelled by us. When I was a young man, I made a model of Nana Bonsu fighting the Fantis. I have portrayed Asen Chibbu, Akoto and Ofosu Apenten in a gold weight. When we are travelling and we see a shell for instance, we keep it in our pocket and copy it later on. The spiral we have taken from the mfonfon leaf. Most of the designs, however, were made by the ancient people and we copy them.\"",
