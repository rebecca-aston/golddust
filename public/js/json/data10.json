	"quote": "One of the goldsmith's functions was to receive and to hand out gold. He was the custodian as well as the manufacturer of weights and possessed several sets each comprising sixty or more pieces. These gold weights called abrammuo were kept in a leather bag called futuo together with several scales nsenia, a gold shovel famfa, spoons nsawa and a box for storing gold dust mmumpuruwa, all made of brass. The scales varied in accuracy and different ones were used depending whether the owner was buying or selling gold. The decorated shovels were used to blow away impurities and test the purity of the remaining gold dust. The small spoons, often with exquisitively worked handles, were required to scoop up gold dust.",
